# PHSX815_Project3

Run the code using 'python3.8 PHSX815_Project3.py'. The details of interpreting the output are explained in the project paper. In this project, we estimate the parameter-the probability of stepping either to the left or the right in a random walk by maximzing the log likelihood. One can estimate the parameter for different hypotheses by playing around with the initial probability.
